Android debugging over bluetooth (without root)


1)  Connect the phone via USB and from the terminal enter (to run adb in tcp ip mode)
    Ex. adb tcpip 4455

2)  Now on the phone enable debugging from Settings -> Developer options -> enable debugging.

3)  Next enable  bluetooth and pair the phone with the laptop. Once paired, unpair the two and on
    the android device go to Settings -> Tethering and portable hotspot then enable
    "Bluetooth tethering"

4)  Now go back to settings -> Bluetooth and repair the device with the laptop.

5)  On Ubuntu click your network icon in the task bar to list the available networks

6)  In Ubuntu click the network icon again after successfully connecting to the bluetooth network
    and click "Connection information" towards the bottom.

7)  From the window that opens, note the Primary DNS IP. Copy it, write it down, whatever you need
    to but you need it for the next step.

8)  Now from the command line again enter:
        adb connect 192.168.44.1:4455
    That should produce
        connected to 192.168.44.1:4455

9)  Now if you're using Eclipse, Intellij or any other IDE with adb support  you can look at logcat
    to start seeing logs from the device:

10) From here on you can deploy your App to the device and/or debug it without a USB. And obviously
    each time just pair the devices and reconnect. You won't have to repeat all the steps - just
    those two.
